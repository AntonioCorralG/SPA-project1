      <h2>A little about the author</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up in San Antonio, TX and studied business for my undergrad. I'm
        currently completing a front-end certificate through the harvard
        extension schoool.

      <h3>Past Experience:</h3>
      <p>

        Web development is there. I would say I have a decent grasp of JS, html,
        and CSS, but I would like to focus on improving my React skills. I've
        done some work in react, but I want to work independently on more
        project in order to master more of the syntax and specifc hooks. For
        example the useEffect and useRef.
      </p>

      <h3>Why this course?</h3>
      <p>
        I decided to take this course because React is the most used frontend
        framework. It is also the framework I'm using at work. I have a basic
        understanding of react, but I want to be able to master more of the
        challenges that goes with working in react such as redux.
